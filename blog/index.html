            This week we read chapter 1 and began learning HTML. Before this class,
            I haven't had much experience with html. One of the readings discussed 
            the anatomy of an HTML document which was described as a tree (as shown 
            in the image below). This explanation helped me to understand the best 
            way to start and layout my HTML document. The readings then talked about 
            different tags such as headers, paragraphs, blockquotes, ordered and unordered
            lists, images and links.

            <br> In chapter 2, I learned about more tags such as the figure tag which can
            people to add a caption to some content. The chapter also discussed how to create
            table in html and using 
            <a href="https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/html/how-to-add-border-to-html-table.html"> w3docs</a>
            I was able to add a border to the table such as the one below.
        </p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Company</th>
                <th>Contact</th>
                <th>Country Name</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Gianna Casolara inc.</td>
                <td>Gianna Casolara</td>
                <td>United States</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Jack Button Corp.</td>
                <td>Jack Button</td>
                <td>Mexico</td>
            </tr>

        </table>
