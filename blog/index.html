                <h3>WebDev Aspects: </h3>
                This week we read chapter 1 and began learning HTML. Before this class,
                I haven't had much experience with html. One of the readings discussed 
                the anatomy of an HTML document which was described as a tree (as shown 
                in the image below). This explanation helped me to understand the best 
                way to start and layout my HTML document. The readings then talked about 
                different tags such as headers, paragraphs, blockquotes, ordered and unordered
                lists, images and links.

                <br>
                <br> In chapter 2, I learned about more tags such as the figure tag which can
                people to add a caption to some content. The chapter also discussed how to create
                table in html and using 
                <a href="https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/html/how-to-add-border-to-html-table.html"> w3docs</a>
                I was able to add a border to the table such as the one below using the follwoing code in my style tag. <br>
                <div class="tablePic">
                    <div class="container">
                        <pre>

                            th,
                            td {
                                background-color: white;
                                padding: 10px;
                                border: 1px solid black;
                                border-collapse: collapse;
                            }
                        </pre>

                                <td>Jack Button</td>
                                <td>Mexico</td>

                    This week we put what we read in chapter 2 to the test! This chapter discussed things like html entities which are
                    used for reserved html characters such as &lt; or &gt;. We also talked a little bit about how buttons in html work. 
                    This allowed me to create the blogs button at the top of this page where if you hover over it, it gives you a list
                    of all the blog posts on my page. When you select a blog the page should redirect you to that post. I am currently 
                    on how to make it move so that the post is on the top of the page. <br> <br>

                    This week we read chapter 3 and 4. We learned about css and how to to 
                    make classes for different tags. This allows us to make the page more exciting 
                    by adding color and being able to create different sections.
                    These chapters discussed how to change fonts, background colors, and font colors 
                    which allowed me update my blog page to be prettier

        <h2><a name="Blog3">Blog 3: Sept. 19th, 2021</a></h2>

        <div class="posts">
                <p>
                    For this blog post we were asked to chose one of the aspects of web development and 
                    according to 
                    <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/2019/01/28/seven-aspects-of-website-design-crucial-for-drawing-in-customers/?sh=463cb4264137"> Forbes.com</a>
                    , there are 7 aspects of web development that are very important to attract users. For 
                    the purpose of this blog post, I am going to discuss the importance of navigation on a 
                    web page since we will be building a static site for a customer in this class.
                    <br><br>
                    Navigation is important in web developement because the users are looking for information 
                    and they don't want to hav to figure out how to work the website as well. For example,  
                    when I was looking for a source to use for this article, I ran into sites that made it hard 
                    for me to find the information I wanted. So of cource, in pure GenZ fashion, I just went to 
                    a different page to get the information. If was a user looking to buy an item for that site, 
                    the site would have lost my business. One way that can allow you site to be more user friendly 
                    in terms of navigation, is to have a floating optios or menu bar on the page. <br>
                    An example of this would be
                    <a href="https://www.harrisonburgelectric.com/"> Harrisonburgelectric.com</a>'s 
                    page. As you can see when you load the page,  the menu bar is located at the top, but as you 
                    scroll down the menu bar stays at the top. This allows easy navigation to anywhere on the site.
